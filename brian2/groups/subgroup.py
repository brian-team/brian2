    Parameters
    ----------
    source : SpikeSource
        The source object to subgroup.
    start, end : int
        Select only spikes with indices from ``start`` to ``end-1``.
    name : str, optional
        A unique name for the group, or use ``source.name+'_subgroup_0'``, etc.
    
    Notes
    -----
    
    Functions differently to Brian 1.x subgroup in that:
    
    * It works for any spike source
    * You need to keep a reference to it
    * It makes a copy of the spikes, and there is no direct support for
      subgroups in `Connection` (or rather `Synapses`)
