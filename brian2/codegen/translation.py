'''
This module translates a series of statements into a language-specific
syntactically correct code block that can be inserted into a template.

It infers whether or not a variable can be declared as
constant, etc. It should handle common subexpressions, and so forth.

The input information needed:

* The sequence of statements (a multiline string) in standard mathematical form
* The list of known variables, common subexpressions and functions, and for each
  variable whether or not it is a value or an array, and if an array what the
  dtype is.
* The dtype to use for newly created variables
* The language to translate to

        A dict of ``(var, spec)`` where ``var`` is a variable name whose type
        is specified by ``spec``, a `Specifier` object. These include

        `ArrayVariable` for a value coming from an array of values,
        `Index` for the name of the index into these arrays, and
        `Subexpression` for a common subexpression used in the code.
        There should only be a single `Index` specifier, and the name
        should correspond to that given in the `ArrayVariable`
        specifiers.
