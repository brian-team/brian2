'''
This module translates a series of statements into a language-specific
syntactically correct code block that can be inserted into a template.

It infers whether or not a variable can be declared as
constant, etc. It should handle common subexpressions, and so forth.

The input information needed:

* The sequence of statements (a multiline string) in standard mathematical form
* The list of known variables, common subexpressions and functions, and for each
  variable whether or not it is a value or an array, and if an array what the
  dtype is.
* The dtype to use for newly created variables
* The language to translate to

def analyse_identifiers(code, variables, recursive=False):
    '''
    Analyses a code string (sequence of statements) to find all identifiers by type.
    
    In a given code block, some variable names (identifiers) must be given as inputs to the code
    block, and some are created by the code block. For example, the line::
    
        a = b+c
        
    This could mean to create a new variable a from b and c, or it could mean modify the existing
    value of a from b or c, depending on whether a was previously known.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    code : str
        The code string, a sequence of statements one per line.
    variables : dict of `Variable`, set of names
        Specifiers for the model variables or a set of known names
    recursive : bool, optional
        Whether to recurse down into subexpressions (defaults to ``False``).
    
    Returns
    -------
    newly_defined : set
        A set of variables that are created by the code block.
    used_known : set
        A set of variables that are used and already known, a subset of the
        ``known`` parameter.
    unknown : set
        A set of variables which are used by the code block but not defined by
        it and not previously known. Should correspond to variables in the
        external namespace.
