class MagicNetwork(Network):
    '''
    `Network` that automatically adds all Brian objects
    
    In order to avoid bugs, this class will occasionally raise
    `MagicError` when the intent of the user is not clear. See the notes
    below for more details on this point. If you persistently see this
    error, then Brian is not able to safely guess what you intend to do, and
    you should use a `Network` object and call `Network.run` explicitly.
    
    Note that this class cannot be instantiated by the user, there can be only
    one instance `magic_network` of `MagicNetwork`.

    Notes
    -----
    
    All Brian objects that are visible at the point of the `run` call will be
    included in the network. This class is designed to work in the following
    two major use cases:
    
    1. You create a collection of Brian objects, and call `run` to run the
       simulation. Subsequently, you may call `run` again to run it again for
       a further duration. In this case, the `Network.t` time will start at 0
       and for the second call to `run` will continue from the end of the
       previous run.
       
    2. You have a loop in which at each iteration, you create some Brian
       objects and run a simulation using them. In this case, time is reset to
       0 for each call to `run`.
       
    In any other case, you will have to explicitly create a `Network` object
    yourself and call `Network.run` on this object. Brian has a built in
    system to guess which of the cases above applies and behave correctly.
    When it is not possible to safely guess which case you are in, it raises
    `MagicError`. The rules for this guessing system are explained below.
    
    If a simulation consists only of objects that have not been run, it will
    assume that you want to start a new simulation. If a simulation only
    consists of objects that have been simulated in the previous `run` call,
    it will continue that simulation at the previous time.

    If neither of these two situations apply, i.e., the network consists of a
    mix of previously run objects and new objects, an error will be raised.

    In these checks, "non-invalidating" objects (i.e. objects that have
    `BrianObject.invalidates_magic_network` set to ``False``) are ignored, e.g.
    creating new monitors is always possible.

    Runs a simulation with all "visible" Brian objects for the given duration.
    Calls `collect` to gather all the objects, the simulation can
    be stopped by calling the global `stop` function.
    
    In order to avoid bugs, this function will occasionally raise

    error, then Brian is not able to safely guess what you intend to do, and
    you should use a `Network` object and call `Network.run` explicitly.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    duration : `Quantity`
        The amount of simulation time to run for. If the network consists of
        new objects since the last time `run` was called, the start time will
        be reset to 0. If `run` is called twice or more without changing the
        set of objects, the second and subsequent runs will start from the
        end time of the previous run. To explicitly reset the time to 0,
        do ``magic_network.t = 0*second``.
    report : {None, 'stdout', 'stderr', 'graphical', function}, optional
        How to report the progress of the simulation. If None, do not
        report progress. If stdout or stderr is specified, print the
        progress to stdout or stderr. If graphical, Tkinter is used to
        show a graphical progress bar. Alternatively, you can specify
        a callback ``function(elapsed, complete)`` which will be passed
        the amount of time elapsed (in seconds) and the fraction complete
        from 0 to 1.
    report_period : `Quantity`
        How frequently (in real time) to report progress.
    profile : bool, optional
        Whether to record profiling information (see `Network.profiling_info`).
        Defaults to ``False``.
    namespace : dict-like, optional
        A namespace in which objects which do not define their own
        namespace will be run. If not namespace is given, the locals and
        globals around the run function will be used.
    level : int, optional
        How deep to go down the stack frame to look for the locals/global
        (see `namespace` argument). Only necessary under particular
        circumstances, e.g. when calling the run function as part of a
        function call or lambda expression. This is used in tests, e.g.:
        ``assert_raises(MagicError, lambda: run(1*ms, level=3))``.

    ----------
    name : str, optional
        The name of the snapshot to restore, if not specified uses

    filename : str, optional
        The name of the file from where the state should be restored. If
        not specified, it is expected that the state exist in memory
        (i.e. `Network.store` was previously called without the ``filename``
        argument).
    restore_random_state : bool, optional
        Whether to restore the state of the random number generator. If set
        to ``True``, going back to an earlier state of the simulation will
        continue exactly where it left off, even if the simulation is
        stochastic. If set to ``False`` (the default), random numbers are

        regardless of whether `store`/`restore` has been used or not. Note
        that this also restores numpy's random number generator (since it is
        used internally by Brian), but it does *not* restore Python's
        builtin random number generator in the ``random`` module.
