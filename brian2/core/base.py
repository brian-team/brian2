    Stops all Brian objects from being automatically detected

    Stops objects from being tracked by `run` and `reinit`.
    Use this if you are seeing `MagicError` on repeated runs.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    erase : bool, optional
        If set to ``True``, all data attributes of all Brian objects
        will be set to ``None``. This
        can help solve problems with circular references stopping objects
        from being garbage collected, and is a quick way to ensure that all
        memory associated to Brian objects is deleted.
        
    Notes
    -----
    
    Removes the objects from ``BrianObject.__instances__()`` and
    ``Nameable.__instances__()``.
    Will also set the
    `BrianObject.active` flag to ``False`` for already existing `Network`
    objects. Calls a garbage collection on completion.
