Refractoriness
==============

Brian2 allows to model the absolute refractory period of a neuron in a flexible
way. The definition of refractoriness consists of two components: For what time
after a spike is a neuron considered to be refractory and what changes in the
neuron during the refractoriness.

Defining the refractory period
------------------------------

The refractory period is specified by the ``refractory`` keyword in the
`NeuronGroup` initializer. In the simplest case, this is simply a fixed time,
valid for all neurons::

    G = NeuronGroup(N, model='...', threshold='...', reset='...',
                    refractory=2*ms)

Alternatively, it can be a string expression that evaluates to a time. This
expression will be evaluated after every spike and allows for a changing
refractory period. For example, the following will set the refractory period
to a random duration between 1ms and 3ms after every spike::

    G = NeuronGroup(N, model='...', threshold='...', reset='...',
                    refractory='(1 + 2*rand())*ms')

In general, modelling a refractory period that varies across neurons involves
declaring a state variable that stores the refractory period per neuron as a
model parameter. The refractory expression can then refer to this parameter::

    G = NeuronGroup(N, model='''...
                                refractory : second''', threshold='...',
                    reset='...', refractory='refractory')
    # Set the refractory period for each cell
    # G.refractory = ...

This state variable can also be a dynamic variable itself. For example, it can
serve as an adaptation mechanism by increasing it after every spike and letting
it relax back to a steady-state value between spikes::

    refractory_0 = 2*ms
    tau_refractory = 50*ms
    G = NeuronGroup(N, model='''...
                                drefractory/dt = (refractory_0 - refractory) / tau_refractory : second''',
                    threshold='...', refractory='refractory',
                    reset='''...
                             refractory += 1*ms''')
    G.refractory = refractory_0

In some cases, the condition for leaving the refractory period is not easily
expressed as a certain time span. For example, in a Hodgkin-Huxley type model the
threshold is only used for *counting* spikes and the refractoriness is used to
prevent to count multiple spikes for a single threshold crossing (the threshold
condition would evaluate to ``True`` for several time points). Leaving the
refractory period is not easily expressed as a time span but more naturally as
a condition that the neuron should remain refractory for as long as it stays
above the threshold. This can be achieved by using a string expression for
the ``refractory`` keyword that evaluates to a boolean condition::

    G = NeuronGroup(N, model='...', threshold='v > -20*mV',
                    refractory='v >= -20*mV')

The ``refractory`` keyword should be read as "stay refractory as long as the
condition remains true". In fact, specifying a time span for the refractoriness
will be automatically transformed into a logical expression using the current
time ``t`` and the time of the last spike ``lastspike``. Specifying
``refractory=2*ms`` is equivalent to specifying
``refractory='(t - lastspike) <= 2*ms'``.

Defining model behaviour during refractoriness
----------------------------------------------

The refractoriness definition as described above does not have any effect by
itself: It is also necessary to define what changes during refractoriness.
There are at least two common implementations of refractoriness: One or several
state variables are clamped at their resting value during refractoriness, or
the state variables continue to evolve but threshold crossings are ignored.

To model the first kind of behaviour (clamped variables), variables that should
stop being updated during refractoriness can be marked with the
``(unless refractory)`` flag::

    G = NeuronGroup(N, '''dv/dt = -(v + w)/ tau_v : 1 (unless refractory)
                          dw/dt = -w / tau_w : 1''',
                    threshold='v > 1', reset='v=0; w+=0.1', refractory=2*ms)

In the above model, the ``v`` variable is clamped at 0 for 2ms after a spike but
the adaptation variable ``w`` continues to update during this time.

The second behaviour (ignore threshold crossings) is already implemented
automatically -- the threshold condition can only evaluate to ``True`` if
the ``not_refractory`` variable is ``True``. This is achieved by automatically
appending ``and not_refractory`` to the threshold condition.
In the following model, the variable ``v`` continues to update during the
refractory period but it does not elicit a spike if it crosses the threshold::

    G = NeuronGroup(N, 'dv/dt = -v / tau : 1',
                    threshold='v > 1', reset='v=0',
                    refractory=2*ms)
