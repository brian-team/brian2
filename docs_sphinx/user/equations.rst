Equations
=========

Equation strings
----------------
Equations are used both in `NeuronGroup` and `Synapses` to:

* define state variables
* define continuous-updates on these variables, through differential equations

Equations are defined by multiline strings.

An Equation is a set of single lines in a string:
    (1) ``dx/dt = f : unit`` (differential equation)
    (2) ``x = f : unit`` (static equation)
    (3) ``x : unit`` (parameter)

The equations may be defined on multiple lines (no explicit line continuation with ``\`` is necessary).
Comments using ``#`` may also be included. Subunits are not allowed, i.e., one must write ``volt``, not ``mV``. This is
to make it clear that the values are internally always saved in the basic units, so no confusion can arise when getting
the values out of a `NeuronGroup` and discarding the units. Compound units are of course allowed as well (e.g. ``farad/meter**2``).

Aliases are no longer available in Brian 2. Some special variables are defined: `t`, `dt` (time) and `xi` (white noise).
Variable names starting with an underscore and a couple of other names that have special meanings under certain
circumstances (e.g. names ending in ``_pre`` or ``_post``) are forbidden.

For stochastic equations with several ``xi`` values it is now necessary to make clear whether they correspond to the same
or different noise instantiations. Two make this distinction, an arbitrary suffix can be used, e.g. using ``xi_1`` several times
refers to the same variable, ``xi_2`` (or ``xi_inh``, ``xi_alpha``, etc.) refers to another. An error will be raised if
you use more than one plain ``xi``. Note that noise is always independent across neurons, you can only work around this
restriction by defining your noise variable as a parameter and update it using a user-defined function. 

Flags
~~~~~
A new syntax is the possibility of *flags*. A flag is a keyword in brackets, which
qualifies the equations. There are several keywords:

*event-driven*
  this is only used in Synapses, and means that the differential equation should be updated
  only at the times of events. This implies that the equation is taken out of the continuous
  state update, and instead a event-based state update statement is generated and inserted into
  event codes (pre and post).
  This can only qualify differential equations of synapses. Currently, only one-dimensional
  linear equations can be handled (see below).
*active*
  this means the variable is only updated during the active (not refractory) state.
  The name may be changed. This can only qualify differential equations of neuron groups.
*constant*
  this means the parameter will not be changed during a run. This allows
  optimizations in state updaters.
  This can only qualify parameters.

Different flags may be specified as follows::

	dx/dt = f : unit (flag1,flag2)

However, the current flags are mutually exclusive.

Event-driven equations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Equations defined as event-driven are completely ignored in the state update.
They are only defined as variables that can be externally accessed.
There are additional constraints:

* An event-driven variable cannot be used by any other equation that is not
  also event-driven.
* An event-driven equation cannot depend on a differential equation that is not
  event-driven (directly, or indirectly through static equations). It can depend
  on a constant parameter. An open question is whether we should also allow it
  to depend on a parameter not defined as constant (I would say no).

Currently, automatic event-driven updates are only possible for one-dimensional
linear equations, but it could be extended.

Equation objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The model definitions for `NeuronGroup` and `Synapses` can be simple strings or
`Equations` objects. Such objects can be combined using the add operator::

	eqs = Equations('dx/dt = (y-x)/tau : volt')
	eqs += Equations('dy/dt = -y/tau: volt')

In contrast to Brian 1, `Equations` objects do not save the surrounding namespace (which led to a lot
of complications when combining equations), they are mostly convenience wrappers
around strings. They do allow for the specification of values in the strings, but do this by simple
string replacement, e.g. you can do::
  
  eqs = Equations('dx/dt = x/tau : volt', tau=10*ms)
   
but this is exactly equivalent to::

  eqs = Equations('dx/dt = x/(10*ms) : volt')

In contrast to Brian 1, specifying the value of a variable using a keyword argument does not mean you
have to specify the values for all external variables by keywords.
[Question: Useful to have the same kind of classes for Thresholds and Resets (Expression and Statements) just
for convenience? Or put this functionality into StringThreshold and StringReset?]

The `Equations` object does some basic syntax checking and will raise an error if two equations defining
the same variable are combined. It does not however do unit checking, checking for unknown identifiers or
incorrect flags -- all this will be done during the instantiation of a `NeuronGroup` or `Synapses` object.


External variables and functions
--------------------------------
During the initialisation of a `NeuronGroup` or `Synapses` object, the namespace used for external variables
is determined. To allow fine control over this process, the constructors take a `namespace` argument.
If no value is given, the namespace will be implicit, consisting of the local and global variables at the point
where the `NeuronGroup`/`Synapses` object is constructed. The `namespace` argument should be a dictionary, if it
is given, it is expected to specify the namespace completely.

Changes in external variable values are not taken into account. If you want to have a variable
that changes between runs (or during a run using a user-defined function), define it as a parameter.
	
Resolution order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For each identifier (variable or function name) in the model equations, a corresponding object will be
determined using the resolution order specified below. If not resolution can be found, an error will be raised.
If more than one resolution is possible, the first in the resolution order will be used but a warning will be
raised.

1. "special variables": `t`, `dt`, `xi` (and `xi_...`)
2. state variables of the `NeuronGroup`/`Synapses` itself.
3. variables from "referred namespaces", i.e. in the `Synapses` class, variables
   from the pre-synaptic group (using a ``_pre`` suffix) or from the post-synaptic
   group (using a ``_post`` suffix or no suffix).
4. explicitly given entries in the namespace dictionary
5. A standard set of numpy functions (with unit-aware/code-generation
   replacements, the names in
   `~brian2.core.namespace.get_default_numpy_namespace`).
6. units (the names in `~brian2.core.namespace.DEFAULT_UNIT_NAMESPACE`),
   containing all registered units plus the standard units (ms, mV, nS, etc.)
7. external variables/functions in the local implicit namespace (if one is used)
8. external variables/functions in the global namespace (if one is used)

	                    mu = -65*mV, sigma=3*mV, tau=10*ms)
	>>> print eqs
	dv/dt = (-0.065 * volt)/(10.0 * msecond) + (3.0 * mvolt)/(10.0 * msecond)**.5*xi  : V

Namespaces
~~~~~~~~~~
**Using implicit namespaces**

This is the typical example script scenario:

.. doctest::

	>>> tau = 10*ms
	>>> V_T = 20*mV
	>>> V_R = -70*mV
	>>> E_L = -70*mV
	>>> G = NeuronGroup(1, 'dV/dt = (E_L - V) / tau : volt', threshold='V>V_T',
	...                 reset='V=V_R')
	>>> print G.namespace['V_R']
	-0.07 V

Creating a NeuronGroup in a function:

.. doctest::

	>>> def create_neurongroup(N, tau_m):
	...     G = NeuronGroup(N, 'dv/dt = -v / tau_m : 1', threshold='v>1', reset='v=0')
	...     return G
	...
	>>> G = create_neurongroup(5, 10*ms)
	>>> print G.namespace['tau_m'] 
	10.0 ms

**Using explicit namespaces**

.. doctest::

	>>> tau = 10*ms  #we will not use this value
	>>> G = NeuronGroup(1, 'dv/dt = -v / tau : 1', namespace={'tau': 20*ms})
	>>> print G.namespace['tau']
	20.0 ms

.. doctest::

	>>> def create_neurongroup(N, **kwds):
	...     G = NeuronGroup(N, 'dv/dt = -v / tau : 1', threshold='v>v_r',
	...                     reset='v=v_t', namespace=kwds)
	...     return G
	...
	>>> G = create_neurongroup(5, tau=10*ms, v_r=1, v_t=0)
	>>> print G.namespace['v_t']
	0
