Coding guidelines
=================

The basic principles of developing Brian are:

1. For the user, the emphasis is on making the package flexible, readable and
   easy to use. See the paper "The Brian simulator" in Frontiers in Neuroscience
   for more details.
2. For the developer, the emphasis is on keeping the package maintainable by
   a small number of people. To this end, we use stable, well maintained,
   existing open source packages whenever possible, rather than writing our
   own code.
