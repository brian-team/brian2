Developer's guide
=================

This section is intended as a guide to how Brian functions internally for
people developing Brian itself, or extensions to Brian. It may also be of some
interest to others wishing to better understand how Brian works internally.

.. warning::
	At the moment, these documents should be considered as "design documents".
	As the design is finished, much of the information here will move to the
	reference section, and some will be deleted or rewritten to make it into
	a guide rather than a set of proposals and ideas.
