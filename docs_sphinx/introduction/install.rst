Installation
============

We recommend users to use the `Anaconda distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_
by Continuum Analytics. Its use will make the installation of Brian 2 and its
dependencies simpler, since packages are provided in binary form, meaning that
they don't have to be build from the source code at your machine. Furthermore,
our automatic testing on the continuous integration services travis_ and appveyor_
are based on Anaconda, we are therefore confident that it works under this
configuration.

However, Brian 2 can also be installed independent of Anaconda, either with
other Python distributions (`Enthought Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`_,
`Python(x,y) for Windows <https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_, ...) or simply
based on Python and ``pip`` (see :ref:`installation_from_source` below).

Installation with Anaconda
--------------------------

Installing Anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`Download the Anaconda distribution <https://continuum.io/downloads>`_
for your Operating System. For Windows users that want to use Python 3.x, we
strongly recommend installing the 32 Bit version even on 64 Bit systems, since
setting the compilation environment (see :ref:`installation_cpp` below) is less
complicated in that case. Note that the choice between Python 2.7 and Python 3.x
is not very important at this stage, Anaconda allows you to create a Python 3
environment from Python 2 Anaconda and vice versa.

After the installation, make sure that your environment is configured to use
the Anaconda distribution. You should have access to the ``conda`` command in
a terminal and running ``python`` (e.g. from your IDE) should show a header like
this, indicating that you are using Anaconda's Python interpreter::

    Python 2.7.10 |Anaconda 2.3.0 (64-bit)| (default, May 28 2015, 17:02:03)
    [GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    Anaconda is brought to you by Continuum Analytics.
    Please check out: http://continuum.io/thanks and https://binstar.org

Here's some documentation on how to set up some popular IDEs for Anaconda:
https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/ide_integration

Installing Brian 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can either install Brian 2 in the Anaconda root environment, or create a
new environment for Brian 2 (http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html). The
latter has the advantage that you can update (or not update) the dependencies
of Brian 2 independently from the rest of your system.

Since Brian 2 is not part of the main Anaconda distribution, you have to install
it from the `brian-team channel <https://conda.anaconda.org/brian-team>`_. To do
so, use::

    conda install -c brian-team brian2

You can also permanently add the channel to your list of channels::

    conda config --add channels brian-team

This has only to be done once. After that, you can install and update the brian2
packages as any other Anaconda package::

    conda install brian2


Installing other useful packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are various packages that are useful but not necessary for working with
Brian. These include: matplotlib_ (for plotting), nose_ (for running the test
suite), ipython_ and jupyter_-notebook (for an interactive console). To install
them from anaconda, simply do::

    conda install matplotlib nose ipython jupyter-notebook

You should also have a look at the brian2tools_ package, which contains several
useful functions to visualize Brian 2 simulations and recordings. You can
install it with pip or anaconda, in the same way as Brian 2 itself, e.g. with::

    conda install -c brian-team brian2tools

.. _installation_from_source:

Installation from source
------------------------
If you decide not to use Anaconda, you can install Brian 2 from the Python
package index: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Brian2

To do so, use the ``pip`` utility::

    pip install brian2

You might want to add the ``--user`` flag, to install Brian 2 for the local user
only, which means that you don't need administrator privileges for the
installation.

In principle, the above command also install Brian's dependencies.
Unfortunately, this does not work for ``numpy``, it has to be installed in a
separate step before all other dependencies (``pip install numpy``), if it is
not already installed.

If you have an older version of pip, first update pip itself::

    # On Linux/MacOsX:
    pip install -U pip

    # On Windows
    python -m pip install -U pip

If you don't have ``pip`` but you have the ``easy_install`` utility, you can use
it to install ``pip``::

    easy_install pip

If you have neither ``pip`` nor ``easy_install``, use the approach described
here to install ``pip``: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/


Alternatively, you can download the source package directly and uncompress it.
You can then either run ``python setup.py install`` or
``python setup.py develop`` to install it, or simply add
the source directory to your ``PYTHONPATH`` (this will only work for Python
2.x).


.. _installation_cpp:

Requirements for C++ code generation
------------------------------------

C++ code generation is highly recommended since it can drastically increase the
speed of simulations (see :doc:`../user/computation` for details). To use it,
you need a C++ compiler and either Cython_ or weave_ (only for Python 2.x).
Cython/weave will be automatically installed if you perform the installation via
Anaconda, as recommended. Otherwise you can install them in the usual way, e.g.
using ``pip install cython`` or ``pip install weave``.

Linux and OS X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On Linux and Mac OS X, you will most likely already have a working C++ compiler
installed (try calling ``g++ --version`` in a terminal). If not, use your
distribution's package manager to install a ``g++`` package.

.. _compiler_setup_windows:

Windows
~~~~~~~
On Windows, the necessary steps to get :ref:`runtime` (i.e. Cython/weave) to work
depend on the Python version you are using:

**Python 2.7**

* Download and install the `Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7  <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266>`_

This should be all you need.

**Python 3.4**

* Download and install the `Microsoft .NET Framework 4 <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851>`_
* Download and install the `Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4 <http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=8279>`_

For 64 Bit Windows with Python 3.4, you have to additionally set up your
environment correctly every time you run your Brian script (this is why we
recommend against using this combination on Windows). To do this, run the
following commands (assuming the default installation path) at the CMD prompt,
or put them in a batch file::

    setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion
    CALL "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd" /x64 /release
    set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1

**Python 3.5**

* Download and install `Visual Studio Community 2015 <https://www.visualstudio.com/>`_. Do not chose the default
  install but instead customize it, the only necessary option is "Programming Languages / Visual C++ / Common Tools for
  Visual C++ 2015"

For :ref:`cpp_standalone`, you can either use the compiler installed above or any other version of Visual Studio -- in this
case, the Python version does not matter.

Try running the test suite (see :ref:`testing_brian` below) after the
installation to make sure everything is working as expected.

.. _development_install:

Development version
-------------------

We do not publish the latest development code on *anaconda.org* or *PyPI*, but
you can directly install it from *github*. It can however be useful to first
install the Brian 2 conda package as described above, since this will install
all the necessary dependencies. Before continuing, remove the installed Brian 2
package with::

    conda remove brian2

or (if you followed the "Installation from source" instructions)::

    pip uninstall brian2

To install Brian's development version, clone the git repository at github
(https://github.com/brian-team/brian2) to a directory of your choice::

    git clone https://github.com/brian-team/brian2.git <TARGET_DIRECTORY>

and from within the target directory run::

    pip install -e .

This will install a link to the source directory, future updates from the
github repository (i.e. via ``git pull``) will be taken into account
automatically, there's no need to reinstall after very change.
Note that this only works for Python 2.x, if you use Python 3.x, you'll
actually have to run the above command again after every update, since the code
is written for Python 2 and needs to be translated with the ``2to3.py`` utility.

Finally, another option is to use ``pip`` to directly install from github::

    pip install https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/archive/master.zip


.. _testing_brian:

Testing Brian
-------------

If you have the nose_ testing utility installed (``conda install nose`` or
``pip install nose``), you can run Brian's test suite::

    >>> import brian2
    >>> brian2.test()

It should end with "OK", showing a number of skipped tests but no
warnings or errors. For more control about the tests that are run see the
:doc:`developer documentation on testing <../developer/guidelines/testing>`.
